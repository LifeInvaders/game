4.	Assign the CableProceduralSimple's values as desired:
		Point Density = how many points per unit length will define the cable (smaller density means better performance).
		Sag Amplitude = how far the cable will sag in the middle in Unity units (meters).
		Sway Multiplier = how far the cable will sway side to side and up and down in Unity units.
		Sway X Multiplier = this will change how much the cable will sway in the local X direction.
		Sway Y Multiplier = this will change how much the cable will sway in the local Y direction.
		Sway Frequency = how many times the cable will cycle per second (Hertz).


Tips:

1. For Chains, set the lineRenderer's "Texture Mode" to "Repeat Per Segment".
